Class - Ephemeral Authentication
===================================

The Ephemeral Authentication lab is a combination of multiple features included in Access Policy Manager to enhance security for Authentication schemes. The first module will cover the implementation of **Client Certificate Constrained Delegation (C3D)** features enhanced in APM. This use case is often referred to as CertSSO.  The second module covers the **Privileged User Access** solution with a specific focus on ephemeral authentication for SSH access to network devices, as well integration with code respositories.

This class covers the following topics related to Ephemeral Authentication:

- LDAP Ephemeral Authentication
- RADIUS Ephemeral Authentication
- HTML5 SSH
- C3D APM Enhancements

Expected time to complete: **1 hour**
